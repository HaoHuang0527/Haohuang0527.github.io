I am an undergraduate student majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hkust.edu.hk/).

Language constructs infinite possibilities from finite linguistic units. This principle inspires my passion for harnessing large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), and diffusion-based multimodal generative AI to emulate and extend this capability.

Designing Principled Inductive Biases for Robust Generative Models: My initial research direction tackles the challenge of ensuring robust generalization in multimodal generative models. I worked on integrating BLIP’s semantic understanding with Noise Collage techniques within the Stable Diffusion framework, improving text-to-image alignment and visual diversity. This project highlighted the potential of structural priors to enhance robustness. Using Python, PyTorch, and JAX, I implemented these improvements efficiently. I am eager to further explore symmetry-based biases to strengthen vision-language model reliability. 
Through this work, I learned to approach research by breaking down complex goals into actionable steps. I also refined my ability to communicate findings effectively. However, manually defining biases proved labor-intensive, motivating me to investigate automated methods inspired by linguistic adaptability.

Enhancing Reasoning in Large Language Models through Adaptive Learning: A key issue in LLMs is eliciting robust reasoning across diverse tasks. My interest grew through the Reasoning-Able Language Models (RAGEN) project, which combines reinforcement learning with LLMs for agent training. I reproduced the model and enhanced its performance in summarizing academic papers, highlighting the challenge of distilling complex information. I plan to develop scalable frameworks using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to optimize reasoning-action interactions.
This experience sharpened my collaborative and iterative skills, translating initial ideas into implementable algorithms. I also recognized how adaptive learning can mirror human reasoning, fueling my desire to explore RL’s potential further.

Through these projects, I have honed skills in model fine-tuning, multi-modal integration (BLIP, CLIP), reinforcement learning, algorithm implementation, and performance analysis, using tools like PyTorch, Hugging Face, and frameworks for both vision and language models. I am confident in my ability to tackle challenges at the intersection of these fields, and excited to continue exploring how LLMs and computer vision can together advance intelligent AI systems.
