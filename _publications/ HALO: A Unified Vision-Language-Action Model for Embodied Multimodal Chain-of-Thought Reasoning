title: "HALO: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Embodied Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reasoning"
collection: underreview
permalink:  
excerpt: '1. We proposed HALO, a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model enabling embodied multimodal chain-of-thought (EM-CoT) reasoning via sequential textual task decomposition, visual subgoal prediction, and action generation. 2. We designed a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture to decouple semantic reasoning, visual foresight, and action prediction while enabling cross-expert collaboration. 3. We introduced an automated pipeline for synthesizing EM-CoT training data and a tailored training recipe for scalable learning. 4. We achieved superior performance in simulated and real-world settings, outperforming baseline π₀ by 34.1% on the RoboTwin benchmark; demonstrated strong generalization under aggressive unseen environmental randomization.'
